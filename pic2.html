    <p>The ever-popular quiff haircut is one of hottest short hairstyles for men at the moment. The haircut resembles a pompadour with a more modern take, making it a handsome style that can also suit a number of different hair types. With a combination of cropped sides and longer, top length, it gives your hairstyle versatility without a complex new morning routine to follow.</p>
    <p>If you’re ready to upgrade your look for the new year with a quiff, check out our tips below for styling a textured quiff, a sleek quiff and a voluminous quiff haircut. Plus, find all the products that you’ll need to style your quiff at home, like a pro.</p>
    <h2>What is a Quiff Haircut?</h2>
    <p>If you don’t know what a quiff is by name, you’ve definitely seen this short haircut sported by many professional athletes, actors and musicians because it’s that popular. And no, you don’t have to be famous to give the look a try. The quiff typically sports short hair on the sides of the head and longer strands up top, usually paired with a textured and slightly messy profile.</p>
    <p>In simple terms, it’s a tapered haircut with plenty of length on top, but the top length doesn’t need to look perfectly coiffed. A quiff is imperfect and even rugged-looking which makes it suitable for straight hair, curly hair and everything in between. The style also doesn’t require as much volume up top as the aforementioned pompadour and the top length can be as long or as short as you like. </p>
    <h2>How to Style a Quiff Haircut 3 Different Ways</h2>
    <p>If you want to style your quiff like a pro no matter your hair type, check out three different ways to try.</p>
    <h2>1. Textured Quiff</h2>
    <p>One of the best ways to style a quiff haircut is by adding texture to your strands. Since you already have the length on top, use a texturizing product to create a cool, messy and effortless look. Start by towel-drying your clean strands until they’re damp, then apply a quarter-sized amount of hair putty, like the L'Oréal Paris Studio Line Overworked Hair Putty, and use your fingers to work it through your hair, focusing primarily on the top length. </p>
    <p>This putty has a matte finish so it’s great for adding texture and movement without making your hair look greasy. The more volume, texture and height you want, the more product you should use. For a messy, edgy look, forgo towel-drying your hair and work the hair putty through your damp strands, using your fingers to ever-so-lightly scrunch your hair before letting it dry.</p>
    <h2>2. Sleek Quiff </h2>
    <p>If you’re a fan of sleek, slicked-back styles, then this easy, hair gel technique is for you. It works wonderfully with a deep side-part but it can also work without one. Whatever you pick, the goal is to achieve a completely slicked-back look with all of your strands pulled back and held in place. </p>
    <p>Start with clean, damp hair and use a comb to part your hair. Then, reach for a non-sticky hair gel, like the L'Oréal Paris Studio Line Invisi Gel and squeeze a dime-sized amount into your hands. Apply the gel evenly throughout your damp strands before combing through to shape and style your sleek hairdo. </p>
    <h2>3. Voluminous Quiff</h2>
    <p>The overall goal of styling a quiff haircut is volume, so this option is a no-brainer. A dollop of volumizing hair mousse can give your quiff the perfect boost it needs to stand out without looking as if you’re trying too hard. It’s also a great way to utilize your hair’s natural volume if you have curly or wavy hair.</p>
    <p>Before picking up your mousse, wash your hair with a volume-boosting shampoo and conditioner like L’Oréal Paris Elvive Hyaluron + Plump Hydrating Shampoo, Paraben-Free and the L’Oréal Paris Elvive Hyaluron Plump Hydrating Conditioner, Paraben-Free. This duo contains hyaluronic acid to replump dry strands, giving your hair noticeable body, volume and shine. </p>
    <p>After you’ve towel-tried your hair and it’s halfway dry but slightly damp, reach for the L'Oréal Paris Advanced Hairstyle BOOST IT Volume Inject Mousse and apply the mousse to your hair, focusing mainly on the lengths and ends. Let your hair air dry and your voluminous quiff is done</p>
    <p>If you don’t have natural waves to add volume, use your blow dryer and a round-barrel hair brush to blow-dry your hair while pulling it back and upwards to create volume and lift at the roots. </p>
