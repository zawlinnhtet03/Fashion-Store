    <h2>7 Runway-Approved Fashion Trends For Spring 2023</h2>
    <p>Spring has officially sprung, which means it is time to kick spring fashion trends into high gear and embrace the styles of the new season. Wondering what trends are worth investing in this year? Don’t worry, because I have rounded up 7 of spring’s hottest trends, straight from the runways of New York, Paris, London, and Milan.</p>
    <p>Keep scrolling for the top trends plus where to shop to get the look for yourself.</p>
    <h2>1)Cut-Outs</h2>
    <p>Get ready to show some skin this spring and summer, as cutouts were all over the runways. Designers like Stella McCartney included asymmetric cutouts and shapes, and elsewhere at shows like Prabal Gurung and David Koma, backs, waists, hips, and more were all on display with artful cutouts.</p>
    <p>Give your classic black dress a spring 2022 upgrade with this fun version from The Wolf Gang. Featuring a side slit and cutout detail on the back, you will want to wear this to all your summer events.</p>
    <h2>2)Ultra-Mini Skirts</h2>
    <p>If there is one talked-about trend of 2022, it is the micro-mini skirt as made popular by Miu Miu. Nicole Kidman, Hailey Bieber, Saweetie, and just about every fashion influencer in the world has rocked some version of this cheeky (perhaps literally) skirt that combines our current fascination with Y2K classics and prep school-inspired style. Not everyone will be into this look, but it certainly is an incredible style statement.</p>
    <p>Storets has an affordable take on the ultra-mini trend that is also more wearable for everyday life. I love the detail of the over-long pockets. Wear with an oversize knit sweater or go all-in on the shrunken proportions with a cropped top.</p>
    <h2>3)Orange</h2>
    <p>Bright colors were all over the spring runways, including electric green, hot pink, and my personal favorite, vibrant orange. Orange can be an intimidating color for some, especially if you tend to gravitate towards neutrals, but I highly recommend dipping a toe into the colorful side of things and sport some orange this season.</p>
    <p>This gorgeous dress from Cult Gaia combines the orange color trend with the previously-mentioned cut-out trend. It is a great option for tropical vacations and warm-weather weddings alike.</p>
    <h2>4) Little Top, Big Jacket</h2>
    <p>Are you sensing a theme yet in this year’s trends? In short, Spring 2022 is all about having fun with fashion and showing off some skin in unexpected ways, and that goes for the “little top, big jacket” look as well. A bralette or bikini top paired with an oversized, menswear-inspired blazer is a cool combination.</p>
    <p>This bralette from NIA will look great whether on its own or paired with an oversized blazer.</p>
    <h2>5) Feathers & Fringe</h2>
    <p>It’s time to get moving with feathers & fringe that move with you. Whether it is a full skirt embellished with tiers of feathers or a top with fringe-accented sleeves, don’t be afraid to wear dynamic pieces.</p>
    <p>You cannot go wrong with a feather mini skirt. This one can be worn for a night out, but I think it would look equally nice with the “little top, big jacket” trend to tackle two popular styles in one outfit.</p>
    <h2>6) Low-Rise</h2>
    <p>That’s right, low-rise skirts and pants were all over the spring runways. If you were never a fan of this look in the early 2000s, you can skip out on this one, but if you are ready for a break from high-waisted jeans and skirts, why not mix things up?</p>
    <p>These low-rise boot cut jeans are the pair I wish I had in the early 2000s.</p>
    <h2>7) Y2K Revival</h2>
    <p>Low-rise jeans aren’t the only Y2K-inspired trend that has found its way back to the mainstream. Butterfly motifs, tinted sunglasses, chiffon, and plenty of pink—consider them all back.</p>
    <p>As the name suggests, this Blumarine T-shirt was worn by Maddy Perez (Alexa Demie) in the latest season of Euphoria, a show known for setting the style zeitgeist and deeply inspired by fashion trends of the early 2000s. This top is the perfect combination of nostalgic style and current cool.</p>
